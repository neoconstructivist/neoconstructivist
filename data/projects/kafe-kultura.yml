description: Coffee and Museum in one cup placed on a surface of urban life
introduction: >-
  The idea to realize a project of an experimental café in Minsk has emerged at
  the moment of working on the National pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The
  idea was to invent a space with the conception of a café at the museum, so
  that there would be the feeling of a museum and a café at one and the same
  time. To create the prototype of a conceptual museum.

  The idea to realize a project of an experimental café in Minsk has emerged at
  the moment of working on the National pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The
  idea was to invent a space with the conception of a café at the museum, so
  that there would be the feeling of a museum and a café at one and the same
  time. To create the prototype of a conceptual museum.




  Another essential objective was to construct an urban space with the type of
  audience not typical for a cultural project, the audience, that was forming
  due to the randomness of urban traffic and need to drop in for 10 minutes,
  take some rest and drink a cup of coffee. I would like to update perpetually
  the interior of the café, experiment with expositions but all the processes
  should be payed off with coffee sale. The project succeeded and 2 years of its
  functioning revealed its new aspects I hadn’t thought of when projecting it.




  What kind of future I see for the Kafe Kultura. In this small café, that can
  be a future form of a 'conceptual museum' with its changing exhibitions of
  images and artifacts, I hope to extend the dialogue between citizens, visitors
  of cafe, between image and memory, between present and past. Currently I’m
  exploring the potential of building a physical copy of the café for transfer
  and installation at various possible sites within the EU. The idea being to
  present through video cameras, and Mobile App a real time mirror of life as it
  is simultaneously experienced in the network of cafes, one in Minsk, the
  others in a new temporary location.
