  Memory visualisation as a type of Non-material Restoration of the Museum
  objects
content: >-
  Any object from material things can be studied as a physical object as well as
  an imaginary, non-material object. Museum restoration usually presupposes the
  restoration of physical characteristics, the material state of an object. Our
  method can be applied to its imaginary, valuable, non-material properties that
  get lost or become obsolete over time. The method is based on a presupposition
  concerning the increasing role of a myth of an object as well as the
  information field formed around it with a simultaneous weakening of manâ€™s
  ability to feel the object materially.
